Lampensteuerung
===============
Arduino project to control a lamp. An ultrasonic sensor measures the height of a hand held under the lamp. There are 4 control modes: 

1) short -> On / Off. 

2) long -> Up / dimming down 

3) up -> lamp goes up (as long as the hand is below the sensor) 

4) down -> lamp goes down.
